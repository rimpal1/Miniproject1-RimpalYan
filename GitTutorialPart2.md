Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If no pathspec is given, git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.

`git checkout [<branch>]`

_This command is used to switch from one branch to another._

`git checkout -b [<branch>]`

_This command is used to create and switch to the created branch._

_Remove the remote named `<name>`. All remote-tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are removed._

- `git remote show <name>`

### 12. Master Branch / Main Branch

_A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits. The default branch name in Git is master (now, "main"
). As we start making commits, we’re given a master(main) branch that points to the last commit we made. Every time we commit, the master(main) branch pointer moves forward automatically._

_The “master / main” branch in Git is not a special branch. It is exactly like any other branch._
