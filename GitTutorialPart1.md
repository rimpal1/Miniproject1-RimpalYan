#**Git Tutorial Part1**#

##**Repository**##

A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They are easiest to imagine as a project's folder.
A repository contains all of the project files(including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

##**Clone**##

A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.

##**Fork**##
A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.
